# Thoughts

> Using this to document my thought process 
during the 3 hour development time of this code.

## Initial Thoughts (Pre-Code) / Plan of attack

Write a quick API using Python / Flask / MySQL. It looks
like a lot of data, so possibly a quick script (PHP, because the position requires
us to work in the stack of the client, and multiple languages might be bonus points?)
to summarize the data into hourly summary rows

Should save time for unit tests and documentation

### Plan of Attack

* Grab data
* Code Shell of an API using Flask
* Create Two endpoints
	* Boroughs
	* TripData?
* Write sample SQLite database
* Write unit tests / test harness
* Write data summarization tool
* Write documentation while data summarization tool works
* Test
